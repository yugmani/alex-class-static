  <h1>Class Static Initialization Blocks in JavaScript</h1>

      <h3>Classes, fields and field initialization in a brief</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>It is a part of the ECMAScript 2022 proposal.</li>
        <li>
          While creating a JavaScript class, we can add public, static and
          private fields and methods.
        </li>
        <li>
          Depending on current situation and our intent, we choose a type of a
          property or method.
        </li>
        <li>
          Public fields and methods are better for some situation while private
          are better for another. You can initialize these fields or not.
        </li>
        <li>
          We can also define and initialize class properties inside the
          constructor method. This is useful when we have to create class
          properties based on class parameters. The constructor method also
          allows us to initialize public as well as private fields.
